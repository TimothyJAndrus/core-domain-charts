# First-to-Market Core

A First-to-market Core provides an advantage to the organisation which develops the capability first. But since the complexity of the feature is low, and it is not easily defensible, the competition will soon catch up and it will not be the core domain for a long period of time.

## Engineering Mindset

If you identify a First-to-market Core, appreciate that it is a priority now, but be careful about how much effort you apply to the architecture and development of this capability. You know it won't always be the core, so you should be thinking ahead to the next core domain.

## Example

In the early days of commercial music streaming and downloading, having a catalogue with all of the world's top artists was the key. Signing rights deals with record labels and ingesting all of their music in different formats was essential and time-consuming although not a wondrous engineering challenge.

Over the course of a few years, most platforms had the world's top artists in their catalogue. Now the core domain was discovery - recommendations and suggestions so that people were more likely to find music that was appealing to them faster.
