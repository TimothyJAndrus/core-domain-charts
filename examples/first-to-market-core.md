# First-to-Market Core

![First to  market core](/resources/first-to-market-core.png)

A First-to-market Core provides an advantage to the organisation which develops the capability first. But since the complexity of the feature is low, the competition will soon catch up and it will not be the core domain for a long period of time.

If you identify a First-to-market Core, appreciate that it is a priority now, but be careful about how much effort you apply to the architecture and development of this capability. You know it won't always be the core, so you should be thinking ahead to the next core domain.
