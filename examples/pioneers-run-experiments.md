# Pioneers Run Experiments

![Pioneers run experiments](/resources/pioneers-run-experiments.png)

In case your company follows the **pioneers, settlers and town planners** concept defined by Simon Wardley (see [Wardley maps - Chapter 4](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/doctrine-8bb0015688e5)),
you might want to add an **experimental** area right to the **Core**. Such experiments are carried out by dedicated pioneer or innovation teams with the goal to identify the next big business differentiation.

## Engineering Mindset

> Pioneers are brilliant people. They are able to explore the never before discovered concepts, the uncharted land. They show you wonder but they fail a lot. Half the time the thing doesn’t work properly. You wouldn’t trust what they build. They create ‘crazy’ ideas. Their type of innovation is what we describe as core research. They make future success possible.

That said, pioneers are gambling. It's best to give them a fixed budget and time frame. Many experiments will fail, but if a promising idea is identified, settlers should take over and turn it into a product - the next **Core Domain**.

Don't confuse pioneers work with experiments performed within Core, Supporting or even Generic contexts. Such experiments can be visualized [without using an experimental area](https://github.com/ddd-crew/core-domain-charts/issues/8#issuecomment-647022070).

## Example

A fashion manufacturer is digitizing its B2B sales processes moving their offline presence to digital showrooms and a digital ordering platform.
While the company has set up a cross-functional team with an agile mindset to work on the new platform, they also picked a handful people to form an innovation team.

The innovation team is disconnected from any operational work. It has a fixed budget to run a set of experiments related to improving customer experience of digital showrooms.
Experiments vary from producing fashion videos for new collections to 3D rendering of new designs. They want to go beyond a simple eCommerce solution since their B2B customers are used
to see new designs live in an offline showroom before ordering. Fashion industry is fast moving, with new collections being produced monthly. Hence, a possible solution needs to be cheap and fast enough to keep up with the ever changing products.
It would be too dangerous to run such experiments within the core team. They need to focus on building a scalable, high quality system. The innovation team on the other hand has all the freedom for try and error until they find
a working solution that can be integrated in the core ordering platform.
